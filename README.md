## 1. Getting Started

### Base URL

The base URL for the API is [insert your base URL here].

### Authentication

To access protected endpoints, you need to include an authentication token in the header of your request. The token is obtained during the authentication process.

## 2. User Registration

### Endpoint

- `POST /auth/register`

### Request

```json
{
  "username": "example_user",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
```

## 3. User Authentication

### Endpoint

- `POST /auth/login`

### Request

```json
{
  "username": "example_user",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "token": "your_auth_token"
}
```

## 4. Secure Endpoint

### Endpoint

- `GET /secure/secure-endpoint`

### Request

Include the authentication token obtained during login in the header.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": "Secure data from the endpoint"
}
```

## 5. Rate Limiting

### Strategy

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. The strategy is as follows:

- **Window Time:** 15 minutes
- **Maximum Requests:** 10 requests per IP

### Response

When the rate limit is exceeded, the response will include the following message:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later."
}
```
